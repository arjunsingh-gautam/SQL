## 1. The *Art* of Writing SQL Queries

Itâ€™s a mix of:

* **Clarity** â†’ Write queries that *explain themselves* (use aliases, indentation).
* **Correctness** â†’ The result set must match the problem statement exactly.
* **Efficiency** â†’ Minimize unnecessary scans, use indexes, filter early.
* **Stepwise Thinking** â†’ Translate problem into smaller building blocks (filter, group, sort).

---

## 2. Algorithm (Universal Framework for Writing Queries)

Hereâ€™s a mental *algorithm* that works almost every time:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

* What do I need? (columns, counts, sums, comparisons)
* At what *level*? (row-level, group-level, entire table?)

ðŸ‘‰ Ask: *Do I need detail rows, or aggregated results?*

---

### Step 2: Identify the Data Source

* Which table(s) are involved?
* Do I need joins? Subqueries?

---

### Step 3: Apply Row Filters (`WHERE`)

* Narrow down raw rows before grouping.
* Think: *Which rows matter to me?*

---

### Step 4: Apply Grouping/Aggregation (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)

* Do I need totals, averages, counts?
* If grouping, what is the *unit of grouping* (customer, month, product)?

---

### Step 5: Projection (`SELECT`)

* Which columns/expressions should I display?
* Do I need aliases for readability?

---

### Step 6: Sorting (`ORDER BY`)

* How should results be presented?
* Do I need only top-N (LIMIT/OFFSET)?

---

### Step 7: Check Edge Cases

* NULL handling (`COALESCE`, `NULLIF`).
* Duplicate rows (DISTINCT).
* Empty groups (LEFT JOIN + aggregates).

## 3. How ChatGPT Thinks About SQL Queries

When you give me a SQL task, my internal reasoning looks like this:

**Example Problem:**
*"Find customers who spent more than â‚¹50,000 in total."*

* Step A: Keywords â†’ *"spent more than" â†’ SUM(amount), condition â†’ HAVING*.
* Step B: Identify table â†’ Orders.
* Step C: Unit of grouping â†’ customer.
* Step D: Draft query skeleton:

  ```sql
  SELECT customer_name, SUM(amount)
  FROM Orders
  GROUP BY customer_name
  HAVING SUM(amount) > 50000;
  ```
* Step E: Add polish â†’ alias `total_spent`, formatting, maybe `ORDER BY`.

ðŸ‘‰ I follow the **execution order of SQL** itself (FROM â†’ WHERE â†’ GROUP â†’ HAVING â†’ SELECT â†’ ORDER BY â†’ LIMIT).
This mirrors the algorithm above.

## 4. Why This Algorithm Works Every Time

Because every SQL query is just a combination of:

1. **What rows do I need?** (`FROM`, `WHERE`)
2. **At what level of aggregation?** (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
3. **What columns to output?** (`SELECT`)
4. **How to order/limit them?** (`ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`)

Itâ€™s like solving a puzzle step by step.

âœ… Pro Tip: When stuck, start with a **basic SELECT** and progressively add WHERE â†’ GROUP â†’ HAVING â†’ ORDER.
